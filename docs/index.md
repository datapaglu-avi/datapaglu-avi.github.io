# Hey Everyone 👋🏻

I am Avi Kasliwal - The "Data Paglu". 

I chase data for living - and for fun. With over 4.5 years of experience in the data world. I've worked as a data consultant at ZS Associates and currently serving as BI Engineer at Blinkit. My Expertise lies in data warehouing, ETL pipelines, dbt modeling, and automation with Python.

## Why "Data Paglu"?

Because data isn't just my job - it's my playground. Wether I am analyzing my __Dream 11__ teams, comapring stocks, or hunting for the best price for wishlisted item at Amazon, I love using data to make smart, real-world decisions.
